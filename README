ADBCI README
------------

ADBCI is a simple library for accessing SQL databases using Ada 2005.  It also
contains an experimental active record implementation.

LICENCE
-------

LGPL 3, or (at your option) any later version.

COMPILER SUPPORT
----------------

Known working with GCC-GNAT 4.5.1 or later.

DATABASE SUPPORT
----------------

Supports PostgreSQL 8.0 or later (including 9.x series), and has some
support for recent versions of MySQL (not as well tested as PostgreSQL
support at this moment).

CAVEATS
-------

No UTC/Offset handling in date/time fields yet.  Safest to treat anything in
the database as being UTC, and convert to local time for display.
The Active Record implementation doesn't cache or track object ids, so it is
possible to retreive the same record from the database multiple times without
them referencing the same data in memory.
The Active Record implementation requires that result sets be random access.
Don't access connections or results across tasks.

Example
-------

There is a very simple example included.  It expects to have access to a
database on localhost called "adbci", owned by the user "adbci" with the
password "adbci".

The example can be built by:

    make examples

The output binary is "examples/active_record/bin/active_record".
